# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Nick
**Date:** 2026-01-07

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Evolving lance-context into an emergent coordination layer for LLM-driven development

**Goals:**
- Build a portfolio-quality project demonstrating Anthropic-scale thinking
- Create something that shows deep understanding of LLM orchestration challenges
- Raise the tide of AI for the benefit of humanity
- Get hired at Anthropic

### Key Dimensions

1. **Developer Experience** - Onboarding, intuitiveness, minimal friction
2. **Value Proposition** - Emergent coordination between available capabilities
3. **Professional Polish** - Documentation, branding, code quality ("should be building Claude Code" level)
4. **Ecosystem Fit** - Complement Claude Code evolution, not compete
5. **Strategic Positioning** - Portfolio piece → Anthropic employment pathway

### Session Setup

This session explores strategic product development, pivoting from "semantic search tool" to "emergent coordination layer that helps LLMs optimally orchestrate available tools."

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Strategic product development with Anthropic employment goal

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Question Storming** (Deep): Define the problem space properly ✅ COMPLETE
2. **Cross-Pollination** (Creative): Transfer patterns from successful projects 🔄 IN PROGRESS
3. **Six Thinking Hats** (Structured): Systematically evaluate ideas ⏳ PENDING

## Technique Execution: Question Storming ✅

### The Skeptical Engineer's Questions

**What makes them close the tab?**
- Unclear why they would want this
- No immediate signal of value or problem solved

**What makes them take it seriously?**
- Solves a problem/pain point they recognize OR
- Shows unexpected value they hadn't considered

**Silent objections:**
- "I don't want to learn another tool"
- Underlying concern: trust, not just learning curve

### Trust Calculus

Engineers run constant mental equation:
> Value ≥ (Adoption cost + Abandonment risk + Maintenance burden)

**Trust signals they scan for:**
- Active commits / recent releases
- Maintainer credibility and track record
- Community activity (issues responded to, PRs merged)
- Performance characteristics
- Clean uninstall path

### Ecosystem Positioning Questions

- What happens when Claude Code adds native semantic search?
- What unique value survives native feature additions?
- Could this complement rather than compete?
- Could this lead to acquisition or employment?

### Strategic Endgame Clarity

**Primary goal identified:** Get hired at Anthropic

**Supporting goals:**
- Prove the concept is valuable
- Build reputation as someone who solves real problems
- Create something useful while the gap exists
- Demonstrate mission alignment ("raise the tide for humanity")

### Breakthrough Insight

> "Claude had the tools. Claude knew they existed. But Claude couldn't piece together that it could/should use them together."

This identifies the core problem: **LLMs lack emergent coordination between available capabilities.**

### "Nice Side Project" vs "Should Be Building Claude Code"

| Nice Side Project | Should Be Building Claude Code |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Solves a personal itch | Identifies a pattern affecting many users |
| Works for the author | Works reliably for strangers |
| Code exists | Code is maintainable, tested, documented |
| Posted on GitHub | Actively engages with community |
| "I built a thing" | "Here's what I learned about the problem space" |
| Technical implementation | Product thinking + technical implementation |
| One-off solution | Demonstrates ability to evolve with ecosystem |

**Core principle:** Think at Anthropic scale

### Project Evolution

**From:** Semantic search for codebases (lance-context)
**To:** Emergent coordination layer that helps LLMs optimally orchestrate available tools

**Implications:**
- Domain-agnostic (dev tools, scientific tools, any specialized domain)
- Connects to Dario's interest in accelerating scientific discovery
- Project needs renaming to reflect new vision
- Create project constitution (excluded from repo) to steer direction

## Technique Execution: Cross-Pollination 🔄

### Domain 1: Tool Orchestration Projects

**LangChain — Patterns Extracted:**

| What Worked | What Failed |
|-------------|-------------|
| Perfect timing (first comprehensive LLM glue layer) | Over-abstraction (too many layers) |
| Named the problem (chains, agents, tools, memory) | Leaky abstractions (debug both LangChain AND underlying APIs) |
| Exhaustive integrations (safe default choice) | Moving target (constant API changes) |
| Prolific content (SEO dominance) | Complexity for complexity's sake |
| Raised money (signaled permanence) | Framework mindset vs. library mindset |

**Your Opposite Approach:**
- Stay close to the metal, minimal layers
- If Claude can do it natively, don't wrap it
- Stability as a feature (boring is good)
- Library mindset — use what you need, ignore the rest
- **Invisibility as a feature** — "I don't want you to think about me"

### Domain 2: Portfolio → Hired Patterns

**Examples:**
- Dan Abramov (Redux) → Hired by Facebook for React core
- Rich Harris (Svelte) → Hired by Vercel
- Sebastian McKenzie (Babel) → Hired by Meta
- Tobias Koppers (Webpack) → Hired by Vercel

**Pattern:**
1. Solved a real, widely-felt pain
2. Became maintainer of critical infrastructure
3. Demonstrated technical depth + product sense
4. Visible in community (issues, blog posts, talks)

**Nick's Aspiration:**
> "Become THE expert of a particular domain — its chief proponent, champion, and maintainer."

**Anthropic-Specific Signals:**
- Deep understanding of Claude's capabilities and limitations
- Alignment with mission (safety, beneficial AI)
- Evidence of thinking at scale
- Quality bar in code, docs, communication

### Domain 3: Professional Open Source Signals (Partial)

**What makes a project feel "serious" at first glance:**
- Stars, forks (social proof)
- Recency and volume of commits (active maintenance)
- External mentions (HN, word of mouth)
- README aesthetics (polished appearance)
- Clear description of what it does
- Clear installation instructions

## Key Principles Emerging

1. **Invisibility as a feature** — Only surface when helpful, otherwise disappear
2. **Think at Anthropic scale** — Not personal tool, but pattern that affects many
3. **Emergent coordination** — The core problem to solve
4. **Library not framework** — Use what you need, ignore the rest
5. **Trust signals matter** — Maintenance, credibility, community, clean exit
6. **Become THE expert** — Chief proponent, champion, maintainer of domain

## Next Steps (When Resuming)

1. Complete Domain 3 exploration (professional signals)
2. Run Six Thinking Hats to evaluate and prioritize
3. Synthesize into actionable plan
4. Create project constitution
5. Decide on new project name
